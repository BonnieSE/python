### Python
this is a log to keep track of learning python process

**Day 1**: Learned to define string variables and print them in three different forms: upper(), lower() and title().

**Day 2**: Learned to stripp whitespce and avoid string syntax error.

**Day 3**: Learned to to avoid contetanate errors between string and int/float. And how to avoid Division of integers in Python 2 results in an integer with the remainder truncated.

**Day 4**: Learned how to define a list, specify an elements, append and pop out a value from a list.

**Day 5**: Learned how to work through a list using a for loop, how Python uses indentation to structure a program, and how to avoid some common indentation errors. You learned to make simple numerical lists. 

**Day 6**: Learned list comprehensions, slicing a list in order to work with a part of list, and looping through a list, copying a list but they remain 2 seperate lists, and define a tuple, which is immutable, means the value in the tuple cannot be changed or re-defined once the original tuple is defined.

**Day 7**: Learned about tuples, which provide a degree of protection to a set of values that shouldnâ€™t change, and how to style your increasingly complex code to make it easy to read. Programming often involves examining a set of conditions and deciding which action to take based on those conditions. If statement allows me to examine current state and respond appropriately to that state.

**Day 8**: Learned about checking multiple conditions and if, elif, else chain, plus a review about for loop.

**Day 9**: Learned about using if statements with lists.

**Day 10**: Used multiple lists, for loop & if statements.

**Day 11**: Learned how to define, modify values in a dictionary.

**Day 12**: Learned removing key-value pairs, a dictionary of similar objects, looping through a dictionary and looping through keys and values respectively in the dictionary by the method key().

**Day 13**: Leared about looping through values in dictionary and looping through keys in order.

**Day 14**: learned how to nest multiple dictionaries in a list, nest lists in a dictionary, and nest a dictionary inside
a dictionary.
