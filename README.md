### Python
this is a log to keep track of learning python process

**Day 1**: Learned to define string variables and print them in three different forms: upper(), lower() and title().

**Day 2**: Learned to stripp whitespce and avoid string syntax error.

**Day 3**: Learned to to avoid contetanate errors between string and int/float. And how to avoid Division of integers in Python 2 results in an integer with the remainder truncated.

**Day 4**: Learned how to define a list, specify an elements, append and pop out a value from a list.

**Day 5**: Learned how to work through a list using a for loop, how Python uses indentation to structure a program, and how to avoid some common indentation errors. You learned to make simple numerical lists. 

**Day 6**: Learned list comprehensions, slicing a list in order to work with a part of list, and looping through a list, copying a list but they remain 2 seperate lists, and define a tuple, which is immutable, means the value in the tuple cannot be changed or re-defined once the original tuple is defined.

**Day 7**: Learned about tuples, which provide a degree of protection to a set of values that shouldn’t change, and how to style your increasingly complex code to make it easy to read. Programming often involves examining a set of conditions and deciding which action to take based on those conditions. If statement allows me to examine current state and respond appropriately to that state.

**Day 8**: Learned about checking multiple conditions and if, elif, else chain, plus a review about for loop.

**Day 9**: Learned about using if statements with lists.

**Day 10**: Used multiple lists, for loop & if statements.

**Day 11**: Learned how to define, modify values in a dictionary.

**Day 12**: Learned removing key-value pairs, a dictionary of similar objects, looping through a dictionary and looping through keys and values respectively in the dictionary by the method key().

**Day 13**: Leared about looping through values in dictionary and looping through keys in order.

**Day 14**: learned how to nest multiple dictionaries in a list, nest lists in a dictionary, and nest a dictionary inside
a dictionary.

**Day 15**: The input() method does not work on my spyder 2.7, so I tried to move my focus on while loop today.

**Day 16**: Learned about Avoiding Infinite Loops & Moving Items from One List to Another.

**Day 17**: Learned how to define a function to handle tasks and basic factors in a function "Def", parameters in the parentheses and arguments when we call the function.

**Day 18**: Learned how to use input() to allow users to provide their own information in your programs. Learned to work with both text and numerical input and how to use while loops to make the programs run as long as users want them to. And several ways to control the flow of a while loop by setting an active flag, using the break statement, and using the continue statement.

**Day 19**: Learned setting default value for argument, making an argument optional and return values for a function.

**Day 20**: Learned Using a Function with a while Loop, Passing a List and Modifying a List in a Function.

**Day 21**: Learned about arbitrary keyword arguments and positional arbitrary arguments in a function.

**Day 22**: Import function and excercise.

**Day 23**: Creating and Using a Class.

**Day 24**: Learned Accessing Attributes, Setting a Default Value for an Attribute and Modifying/incrementing an Attribute’s Value Through a Method in a class.

**Day 25**: Learned child class and define attributes and methods to child class.

**Day 26**: Learned create several child class and importing class.

**Day 27**: Learned about importing module and function that is prepared in python and access, read plain files in the computer through python.

**Day 28**: Learned about setting limit to how much data you want to work with, replace() method to replace any word in a string, open() function which needs argument, read() returns an empty string when it reaches the end of the file, retrip() will remove the extra blank line, the readlines() method takes each line from the file and stores it
in a list.

**Day 29**: Learned Writing to a plain File through python and writing to an empty file with multiple lines, and appending to a file, Handling the ZeroDivisionError Exception.

**Day 30**: Learned to deal with exception and making it silent, storing data in json form.

**Day 31**: dump(), load() and refactoring.
